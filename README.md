# SQL
: Implemented a Database Management System by ERD, DDL, DML
<br><br>
In the Transactional Database Programming course, I created the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and
database with Covid-19 raw data of the Kaggle site. Through the analysis, 
I established relationships between entities keeping data integrity and normalization. 
I demonstrated building a database using Data Manipulation Language (DML) 
and Data Definition Language (DDL) proficiently.
